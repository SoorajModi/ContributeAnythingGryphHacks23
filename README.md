# Contribute Anything

"Contribute Anything" is a workshop designed for GryphHacks 2023. Its goal is to encourage students to contribute to their first open source project and guide them through their first steps into the world of open source.

During the workshop, students will fork a public repository, add their contributions, and submit them to the main project. They will have two hours to learn how open source projects work, how to contribute to them, and create whatever they want.
