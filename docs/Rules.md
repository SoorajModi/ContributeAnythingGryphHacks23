# Rules

- You have until the end of the workshop to submit to the main project via a pull request
    - If your initial contribution requires changes, you have until the end of the hackathon to make those changes.
    - No PRs will be merged once the Hackathon has been completed.
    - Your contributions must be created and submitted during the workshop.
- If you are submitting a new contribution, add a folder with the name of your project under the submissions folder. If you are contributing to someone else's contribution add your name to their README.
    - You can make only one new submission, but you may make as many contributions to other submissions as you want.
    - You cannot contribute something someone has already submitted. But you may contribute to someone elseâ€™s submission.
- Must include a README.md with the name of the project, a list of contributors, how to run your project, what it does, and why you contributed it.
- You may complete this individually, partner with others, and use third party libraries.
- Submit as few files as possible, do not submit dependencies (ie. node modules), keep the size of your submission limited.
- Avoid the use of secrets or environment variables, do not submit private keys for any service.
- Keep all contributions professional.
- Have fun, and get creative.
