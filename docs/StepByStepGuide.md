3. `clone` the forked repository locally.

4. Add changes locally, stage and commit changes, push to the remote repository, and then you can create the Pull Request.

You can make the pull request by either clicking the pull request button from your fork, _or_ from the [pull request](https://github.com/SoorajModi/ContributeAnythingGryphHacks23/pulls) tab on the main repository and selecting the `compare across forks` option.

After the Pull request has been reviewed the indicator will change to one of the following indicating that either some changes must be made, there are some comments, or it has been accepted.

If changes are requested there will be a comment indicating the file and line the change is being requested on and a description of the change.

All conversations must be resolved before the PR can be merged. You or the commenter can mark the conversation as resolved if the issue has been addressed.
