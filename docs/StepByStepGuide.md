# Step-by-Step Instructions

1. The first step to adding a new contribution is to create a `fork` of the repository by clicking the fork button at the top right of the page.

2. You will need to then setup the new fork by selecting the Github account to put it under as well as the name of the repository that will be created.

3. The next step is to `clone` the repository locally to add your changes.


4. Once you have made the changes and run `git commit` and `git push` you can create the Pull Request.

You can make the pull request by either clicking the pull request button from your fork, _or_ from the [pull request](https://github.com/SoorajModi/ContributeAnythingGryphHacks23/pulls) tab on the main repository and selecting the `compare across forks` option.

5. Once you select the branch that you are making a pull request from you will need to finish filling out its information.
Some of it will be partially filled out from a template.

It, will automatically assign reviewers, and it will show an orange circle indicator while it is awaiting a review.
