# Step-by-Step Instructions

1. The first step to adding a new contribution is to create a `fork` of the repository by clicking the fork button at the top right of the page.

2. You will need to then setup the new fork by selecting the Github account to put it under as well as the name of the repository that will be created.

3. The next step is to `clone` the repository locally to add your changes.

4. Once you have made the changes and run `git commit` and `git push` you can create the Pull Request.

You can make the pull request by either clicking the pull request button from your fork, _or_ from the [pull request](https://github.com/SoorajModi/ContributeAnythingGryphHacks23/pulls) tab on the main repository and selecting the `compare across forks` option.

5. Once you select the branch that you are making a pull request from you will need to finish filling out its information.
Some of it will be partially filled out from a template.

This is what the newly created Pull Request should look like.
It, will automatically assign reviewers, and it will show an orange circle indicator while it is awaiting a review.

After the Pull request has been reviewed the indicator will change to one of the following indicating that either some changes must be made, there are some comments, or it has been accepted.

If changes are requested then there will be a comment that looks like this indicating, the file, and line that the change is being requested on, and a description of what the change thats requested is.

All conversations must be resolved before the PR can be merged. You or the commenter can mark the conversation as resolved if the issue has been addressed.
