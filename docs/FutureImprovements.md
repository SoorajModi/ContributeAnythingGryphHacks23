# Future Improvements

This was our first time running this event, in the future we can improve it by:

- Teach them anout draft pull requests
- Add simple projects students can contribute to instead of having the students contrubute them. Suggestions include basic react app, HTML page, data structure library, meme folder, hello world program
- Make it a 60 minute workshop at the start of the hackathon, let PRs go through until the last hours of the hackathon
- Remove the `First submission` category, invites spam
- Call out the docs folder and step by step guide in the README
