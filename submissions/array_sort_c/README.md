Project Name: array_sort_c

Contributors: Devin Forrest

How to Run: Compile with gcc then run the output file
            gcc sort.c -o sort.o

What it Does: The program first asks the user to provide the size of the array that they want to sort
              The program then prompts the user for the values in the array to sort once at a time
              The program then uses qsort to sort the array then prints the sorted array

Why I contributed it: It is a good example of the usage of qsort
