# Insertion Sort

This is an example of an implementation of the 'insertion sort' sorting algorithm
in Python. 
Upon calling the function with the given array 'a', it will return 
the elements of that array in ascending order. 

## Usage

Once python is installed the following commands can be used to run it.

$ python InsertionSort.py
```

## Why I Added it
